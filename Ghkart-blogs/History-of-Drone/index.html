                        <h1>Origins of Drones:</h1>
                        <p>
                            The concept of drones can be traced back to the mid-19th century. In 1849, the Austrian army
                            used unmanned balloons
                            loaded with explosives for offensive purposes during the siege of Venice. However, it was
                            not until the early 20th
                            century that the true potential of unmanned flight began to emerge.
                            <br>

                            In 1916, the Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane, developed by Elmer Sperry and Peter Cooper
                            Hewitt, became the first
                            successful attempt at building an unmanned aircraft. This aircraft used gyroscope
                            stabilization and a basic autopilot
                            system. Although it was primarily intended as a weapon, it never saw action during World War
                            I.

                        <h1>Advancements during World War II:</h1>
                        <p>
                            World War II served as a catalyst for the development of drones. Both the Allies and Axis
                            powers recognized the
                            potential of unmanned aircraft for reconnaissance and target practice. The British designed
                            the "Queen Bee," an adapted
                            de Havilland Tiger Moth biplane, which was widely used for target practice by anti-aircraft
                            gunners.
                            <br>
                            Meanwhile, the Germans developed the V-1 flying bomb, also known as the "Buzz Bomb." It was
                            one of the first cruise
                            missiles, with a simple autopilot system guiding it toward its target. The V-1 was a
                            significant step forward in drone
                            technology, laying the foundation for future advancements.

                        <p>
                            Following World War II, interest in drones continued to grow. The United States emerged as a
                            leading force in drone
                            development during the 1950s and 1960s. The creation of the United States Air Force's
                            "Project Red Wagon" led to the
                            development of a wide range of drones, including target drones, reconnaissance drones, and
                            even supersonic drones.
                            <br>
                            During the 1980s and 1990s, significant advancements in microelectronics and computing
                            technologies revolutionized drone
                            capabilities. These advancements allowed for the development of smaller, more agile drones
                            with improved autopilot
                            systems and increased payloads.
